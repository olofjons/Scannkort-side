            <p>
              That children all around the world are missing out in school.

              More and more children are at risk of losing their educational offer. It becomes more important than anyone
              time to get an overview of all children of school age, and various reasons for absence and dropout from school.
              <br> <br>Stay in School uses technologies that exist and are being developed today, and can be used anywhere, even
              in areas with low levels of technological infrastructure.
              <br>
              By analyzing the data one can
              effectively see trends and implement measures where needed.
              <br> <br>The goal is also to collect enough data and
              computing power to be able to use data-driven predictions for trends and come up with preventative

              measures.

              We propose to develop a multi-platform app based on the principles of digitalprinciples.org.
              SiS must be backward compatible with old web technology, and work in any
              preferable browser.
